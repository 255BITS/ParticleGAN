"""Fixed leaderboard denominators, declared tuning budgets and holdout claims.

Presentation contracts shared by the technique inventory, configuration-search
reports and readouts. Nothing here grades, trains or changes a recorded verdict.

* A **fixed, dated test list** is the leaderboard denominator. Every listed
  test counts in every row as PASS, FAIL, not measured or another outcome,
  including tests that a view currently holds or removed from its count. The
  denominator never shrinks silently: a test leaves only through a new dated
  list, which keeps the old one as history.
* A row's **tuning budget** is what was actually declared: the registered
  configuration searches (and their grid sizes) for its family, and whether the
  selected recipe descends from one of them. A family with no declared search
  is labelled untuned.
* A configuration selected on tuning tiers carries a **holdout claim**: whether
  it passed the higher (untuned) tiers. Tuning-tier passes are selection
  evidence and are never presented as independent confirmation.
