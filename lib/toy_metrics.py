"""
Distributional metrics for the 2D Gaussian-grid benchmark.

`mode_coverage` (lib/toy_models.py) answers "did the generator find the modes",
which is the coarse question. These functions answer the finer ones a controlled
comparison of gradient penalties needs:

  * how far is the model distribution from the data distribution
    (`sliced_w1`, cheap and GPU-resident; `exact_w1_w2`, exact but O(n^2 log n)),
  * how well-calibrated is the density it puts on each mode (`mixture_nll`),
  * how balanced is its mass across the 100 modes
    (`mode_recall_and_hists`).

Everything takes samples as (N, 2) tensors on any device. The two torch-only
metrics stay on the input device; the OT one moves to numpy float64.

    Within-mode *core* width, measured so the far tail cannot inflate it.

    `per_mode_moments` reports a second moment about each mode's sample mean.
    On these models that is not a width: a small population stranded whole grid
    cells away dominates the variance *and* drags the mean the variance is taken
    about, so a blob whose core is tighter than the data's can still report a
    std ratio of 5 (see results/metric_recon.md, which established this and from
    which this estimator is taken verbatim). Two changes make the estimate read
    the core instead:

      * **center** -- the coordinate-wise *median* of the mode's samples, not
        their mean. A 3% tail at distance 2.5 moves the mean by 2.5 sigma_true
        and every distance measured from it; it moves the median by nothing.
      * **spread** -- the *median* radial distance, inverted through the 2-D
        isotropic Gaussian relation median ||x - mu|| = sigma * sqrt(2 ln 2).
        Everything past the median is ignored by construction, so the estimate
        depends only on the half of the mass nearest the center.

    On a genuine Gaussian this and `per_mode_std` agree, so their ratio reads
    directly as a tail-inflation factor. `tail_frac_10sigma` is the mass that
    buys that inflation: the fraction of *all* samples whose nearest-center
    distance exceeds 10 * `std`.

    center, and only modes holding at least `min_count` samples contribute.
