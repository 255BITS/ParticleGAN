# API toy goal gallery

These GIFs compare the declared target/behavior with actual public-API outputs.
Each frame is a retained observation; the update, instantaneous metric and budget
are visible. Short runs demonstrate executable tests and goal views; their default
training-budget verdict remains FAIL. Historical trained evidence is unchanged.

Registered variants: **176**. Verified actual-state GIFs: **176**.
The displayed GIFs use a separate reviewed renderer. Original receipts,
numeric observations, training sources and test verdicts remain unchanged.

Completed executions: **171**; failed-attempt views: **5**. Completed default protocols: **171**; default passes: **51**.
Original questions without a runnable API variant: **0**.

These [failed-attempt views](failed-runs.json) retain the original ERROR/FAIL.
They illustrate captured training states and grant no execution completion or default pass.
A numeric export-error PASS remains separate from qualification; failed prerequisites leave continuation unattempted.
