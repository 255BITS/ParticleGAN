# V6 actual-training visualizations

These seven GIFs display certified saved training observations under the V6 source. The pre-run selected BCAP/DualNorm recipe supplies every task; selection is independent of grades. Failed gates remain failed. No models were constructed or queried, and export added no training updates, sampling draws or rescoring.

Clockfree audit is a diagnostic. The remaining tasks are the six required Tier 1 gates. No recipe passed all six, so the twenty required Tier 2 tasks remain ineligible and have no new training media.

Reproduce from the retained original queue and attempt artifacts in the project Python environment:

```sh
python reports/forge/gaussian-smoke-inventory/export_media.py \
  --queue-root runs/forge/gaussian-smoke-inventory-v6 \
  --attempts reports/forge/attempts --campaign gaussian-smoke-inventory-v6 \
  --output runs/software/gaussian-smoke-inventory-v6-media-reproduction
```
