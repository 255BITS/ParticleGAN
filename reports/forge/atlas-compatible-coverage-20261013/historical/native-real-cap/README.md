# Native Atlas real-gradient cap: preserved 80-update pilot

This is the earlier separately preregistered seed-0 native Atlas pair, source `5bc17f2a0984e6dc413ec0ca106d49bff91743798ae5fcc520f8aa26bdef41ff`. It is copied here as historical evidence, not rerun or pooled into selected-cloud coverage.

Native R1 ON fails: mean absolute position 0.005321078, gradient median 0.012204401, 0/24 passing observations. The real KA2-A RMS hinge cap passes: 0.460719913 / 0.405106425, 8/24 passing checks and terminal suffix 8. Both complete 80 updates and 24 observations with unchanged bounds (mean absolute position at least 0.3, gradient median at most 1).

Only the real input-gradient component changes from squared normalized gradient to squared excess RMS over 1. Lambda remains 3; fake cap, Adam/AMSGrad, DV12, noise and later B/anchor/handover are preserved. This is not an output/logit penalty. The 80-update pilot does not test the call-800 handover. Historical Ring failures and unmeasured robustness/transfer prevent a global repair claim.

[Original readout](READOUT.md), [compact result packet](INVENTORY-RECEIPT-PACKET.json), [original independent audit](ROUND-AUDIT.json), [preregistration](preregistration.json), [source/request binding](PRELAUNCH-BINDING.json), and [terminal receipt](TERMINAL-HOST-RECEIPT.json) are unmodified. Every stored result-packet file hash was freshly reverified. [Native GIF](gifs/astra-atlas-squared.gif) and [cap GIF](gifs/astra-atlas-rms-cap.gif) are copied from their original actual-training export, with zero new samples or updates.

The original pair costs 18.490690234 queue / 21.830803280 supervisor seconds under its original ledger. They are not new costs or experiment starts in the three-attempt current coverage campaign. The original readout's timing and PR-reference comments remain historical context, not a current comparator audit.
