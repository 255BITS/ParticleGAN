# BISPF throughput readout

The `bispf-throughput-v1` recipe is **2.15× faster at 256×256 DCGAN** and **about 2.3× faster on the small Forge image tasks**, compared with the selected quintic BISPF winner. It preserves all **19 incumbent numerical passes** across the same 30 task contracts. The [current technique inventory](../technique-inventory.md) remains the single leaderboard. The original opt-in publication at `72db8af31` preserved selection pins and public defaults. The owner subsequently selected this execution policy as the **0.9.1 public default**; archived qualifications and Forge selection pins retain their original identities.

## Measured throughput

All six existing mock-DCGAN particle-cloud tasks ran serially on the same physical RTX A6000, with seed 0, three warmup updates and ten measured complete public `GANTrainer.step` updates. These are median-update rates; input preparation, scoring and media are outside the timed region. Initial model/prior hashes, actual critic/generator batch digests, runtime and physical GPU match within every pair.

| Workload | Control steps/s | Candidate steps/s | Speedup |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 32×32, batch 16 | 35.45 | 36.12 | 1.02× |
| 64×64, batch 16 | 20.05 | 29.27 | 1.46× |
| 128×128, batch 16 | 8.24 | 14.59 | 1.77× |
| 256×256, batch 16 | 2.94 | 6.34 | 2.15× |
| 64×64, batch 64 | 10.89 | 23.32 | 2.14× |
| 64×64, width 128 | 9.01 | 15.25 | 1.69× |

The six-workload geometric mean is **1.66×**. The 2× target is met at 256×256 and batch 64; it is not met uniformly. At 256×256, median latency falls from 339.80 to 157.84 ms and peak allocated memory falls from 2,119 to 1,522 MiB. CUDA graph capture increases cold-start work and can increase memory on smaller workloads. Contention telemetry is unavailable, so ratios describe observed runs rather than a certified exclusive-device ranking.

The unchanged small-image controls use mean synchronized training-update time over all 600 updates, including startup; both arms retain all 24 quality observations. Wider controls exercise BF16 and the graph path.

| Image task | Control ms/update | Candidate ms/update | Speedup | Control / candidate gate |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Stripes, original width 12 | 35.56 | 15.48 | 2.30× | PASS / PASS |
| Bars, original width 12 | 35.29 | 15.38 | 2.29× | FAIL / FAIL |
| Stripes, width 64 diagnostic | 27.02 | 19.23 | 1.40× | PASS / PASS |
| Bars, width 64 diagnostic | 26.27 | 19.30 | 1.36× | PASS / PASS |

Both wider candidate runs finish with HQ 1.0 and all required modes: two stripe modes and four bar modes. Their terminal passing suffixes are 12 and 9 observations, above the required 5. The original narrow bars failure remains a failure. Matching initialization, initial RNGs and final consumed data streams are verified for all four image pairs.

## Quality and policy scope

The combined numerical comparison is **19 PASS / 11 FAIL**, with all 19 incumbent passes retained and no repaired failure claimed. All 26 nonimage final-metric hashes exactly match the archived incumbent. The four ordinary image endpoints differ numerically, while retaining their original gate outcomes.

The ordinary **revision 12** study completes every runnable task in the current tier: **17 PASS / 11 FAIL** over 28 tasks. Tier 1 passes 6/6; Tier 2 passes 10/14 counted tests. Gaussian stability and the three 100-mode acquisition tests fail as they did for the incumbent. The seven held failures remain visible. The source-bound ordinary qualification is **Tier 1, overall FAIL**, with 16/21 counted requirements satisfied and ordinary Tier 3 blocked.

The incumbent’s archived Tier 3 qualification used revision 11, before those four failures were restored as requirements. A separately declared endurance-preservation diagnostic passes the original **1,200/1,200 hold checks and 300/300 extension checks**, completing the unchanged first-convergence stop rule at update 3,282. Those two passes supply regression evidence for the original task contracts and **confer no revision 12 Tier 3 qualification**. The existing verified-parent publication bridge independently validates the word hold’s own restored acquisition checkpoint; all 25 word-hold checks pass.

## Implementation and diagnosis

The current quintic winner spends about 53 ms of its 336 ms 256-pixel update in optimizer polynomial work; convolution forward and higher-order backward dominate. At 64 pixels the optimizer polynomial costs about 15 ms of a 50 ms update. Small kernels still launch one native SVD per spatial offset. The [component profile](profiling.json) keeps unwrapped timing separate from synchronized diagnostic spans and verifies identical plain/instrumented replay states.

One global recipe changes two fields:

- `optimizer_svd_backend="batched"` batches native, rank-masked, absolutely smoothed SVDs for CUDA channel matrices of at most 32 channels. Larger quintic kernels replay the existing FP32 polynomial in optimizer-local CUDA graphs. Graph inputs use contiguous storage, which can change reduction rounding for strided kernels. Dense, bias, sampled-prior and CPU updates retain their original laws. Version-1 checkpoints bind the backend; graph caches are discarded on copy/restore.
- `training_precision="bf16_channels_last"` uses BF16 autocast and channels-last storage for CUDA G/D networks containing a convolution whose largest channel-matrix dimension exceeds 32. Only network forwards autocast. Outputs, losses, master parameters, optimizer arithmetic and SBNP prior regularization remain FP32. Evaluation remains FP32; smaller and nonconvolutional networks keep their original precision.

Learning rates, momentum, Born–Infeld penalty, learned-prior policy and SBNP regularizer are unchanged. Every comparison keeps task architecture, target/data law, seen batches, initial prior law/capacity, public deterministic initialization, seed 0, sampling, update allowance and evaluation cadence fixed. Constructor, data, training-noise and evaluation streams remain separate and checkpointed. Batched SVD and layout/precision changes are explicit numerical policies, without a general bitwise-equivalence claim.

```python
from particlegan import get_recipe

recipe = get_recipe("bispf_optimized", optimizer_svd_backend="batched",
                    training_precision="bf16_channels_last")  # also get_recipe() in 0.9.1
```

Use this default for the measured CUDA image workloads. The 0.9.1 release adds a native-BF16 capability check, falling back to FP32 network execution on unsupported CUDA devices. That fallback is software-tested and supplies no measured speedup or trained quality claim for those devices. Profile the candidate’s remaining 32/64-pixel overhead before another bounded implementation change; no optimizer retuning or seed study is warranted by this result. Natural-image quality is not measured by the synthetic timing workloads or the simple wide-image controls.

## Evidence, budgets and reproduction

The measured implementation was frozen at `bbd95834c`, based on `origin/develop` `de43f22f0`. Scientific source digest `014d8783a85da5a2814e278d59f2e6749620d79fafdbb884cea66a0183e022f8` matches every captured source file in the original publication checkout `72db8af31`. The 0.9.1 default promotion and unsupported-device fallback are subsequent source changes; they do not rebind the frozen experiment evidence. Original receipts, source snapshots, checkpoints, stdout, JSONL streams and profiler traces remain in the local artifact archive. Published receipt projections are display/provenance summaries, not substitutes for original qualification evidence.

- [Source integrity](source-integrity.json), [unchanged leaderboard/pin proof](publication-integrity.json), and [software checks](software-checks.json).
- [0.9.1 default-promotion verification](release-verification.json) and its [reproduction source](verify_release.py): exact recipe binding, two changed scientific source files, unchanged training body outside the capability gate, and 187 passing release checks.
- [Development probes](probes.json), including the first probe’s mismatched preliminary declaration and the retained layout-test failure. They grant no quality credit; the final registered comparison has separate correct bindings.

Publication adds no updates or sampling draws.

Initial profiling additionally reserves 480 seconds and each of the three development probes 240 seconds. There are no paid retries. Small and endurance diagnostic view revision 1 bytes remain archived; revision 2 changes only family-page presentation. Frozen requests retain their original view identities.

Use the original publication checkout `72db8af31` and the project environment with the experiment dependencies to regenerate its reporting from the existing archive, without training:

```sh
python reports/forge/bispf-throughput/publish.py \
  --artifacts /mnt/ml7tb/ParticleGAN-forge/bispf-throughput-20261017
python reports/forge/bispf-throughput/provenance.py \
  --artifacts /mnt/ml7tb/ParticleGAN-forge/bispf-throughput-20261017
```

The registered idea, studies and performance manifests under `configs/forge/` are the reproduction declarations. Exact original execution uses the frozen request/source snapshot and original view identities, rather than a new run silently substituting a current policy. A new source or binding needs its own study identity.

```sh
tail -f /mnt/ml7tb/ParticleGAN-forge/bispf-throughput-20261017/progress.log
```
