## Technique overview

Relativistic Hellinger-Born-Infeld Transport (RHBI) is a clock-free, constant-learning-rate ParticleGAN formulation with no EMA critic copy and no task-shape or step-count gates. It unifies nonlocal scale-equivariant Born-Infeld Optimal Transport, Feydy diagonal-included self-coupling entropic debiasing, local relativistic critic log-odds ascent, and fibre-centered conditional relativistic slack routing inside a single (B+1)x(B+1) slack-screened Sinkhorn variational operator, paired with a smooth C-infinity Born-Infeld endpoint input-gradient cap and degree-of-freedom-aware SBNP particle prior regularization.

## Mathematical formulation

$G$ is the generator, $D$ the raw-score critic, $P$ the task prior with $N$ locations in $\mathbb R^{d_z}$, $y=\{y_j\}_{j=1}^{B_r}$ a real batch, $z\sim P$ a latent batch and $x=\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{B_f}$ with $x_i=G(z_i)$ the generated batch. $\ell_t$ is the exponential moving average ($\beta_\ell=0.1$) of the detached 25th-quantile real nearest-neighbor Euclidean distance. $c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,y_j)=\sqrt{\ell_t^2+\lVert x_i-y_j\rVert_2^2}-\ell_t$ is the physical Born-Infeld ground cost and $\hat c_{ij}=c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,y_j)/\ell_t$ its dimensionless linear screening form. $\tilde d(u)=C_{\max}\tanh((D(u)-\bar D)/C_{\max})$ is the batch-centered, bounded critic log-odds with $\bar D=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbb E[D(x)]+\mathbb E[D(y)])$. $P^{\star(XY)}$ and diagonal-included $P^{\star(XX)}$ are deterministic Sinkhorn couplings on the $(B+1)\times(B+1)$ active-plus-slack polytope with linear screening horizon $\rho=3$, relativistic gain $\tau=2$ and entropic temperature $\varepsilon=0.1$. $g_r=\nabla_y D(y)$ and $g_f=\nabla_x D(x)$ are critic input gradients capped at $\kappa=1$ with Born-Infeld softness $\beta=20$ and sub-unit slope floor $\lambda_{\mathrm{floor}}=0.005$.

**Scale-Equivariant Born-Infeld Cost and Local Horizon**

$$
c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,y_j)=\sqrt{\ell_t^2+\lVert x_i-y_j\rVert_2^2}-\ell_t,\qquad \hat c_{ij}=\frac{c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,y_j)}{\ell_t},\qquad \ell_t=(1-\beta_\ell)\ell_{t-1}+\beta_\ell\,\operatorname{stopgrad}\!\left(Q_{0.25}(d^{\mathrm{NN}}_Y)+10^{-6}\right)
$$

Evaluated via float64 GEMM and algebraic rationalization so gradients remain smooth at zero distance and finite across the full float32 range, matching exact quadratic W2 inside modes while bounding inter-mode pull slopes inside $[-1,+1]$.

**Slack-Screened Unbalanced Sinkhorn Envelope Objective**

$$
\mathcal L_{\mathrm{RHBI}}(X,Y;\psi)=\lambda_{\mathrm{rhbi}}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{B_f}\sum_{j=1}^{B_r}\operatorname{stopgrad}\!\left(P^{\star(XY)}_{ij}\right)c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,y_j)-\sum_{i=1}^{B_f}\operatorname{stopgrad}\!\left(P^{\star(XY)}_{i,0}\right)\frac{\tau}{2}\tilde d(x_i)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,k=1}^{B_f}\operatorname{stopgrad}\!\left(\sqrt{a_i a_k}P^{\star(XX)}_{ik}\right)c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,x_k)\right]
$$

Linear horizon screening ($\rho=3$) routes valley outliers ($\hat c_{ij}>\rho$) to unit-slope centered critic log-odds ascent ($\tau/2=1$), while Feydy diagonal self-coupling cancels intra-mode entropic contraction without inflating isolated singletons.

**Smooth Born-Infeld Endpoint Critic Penalty**

$$
R_{\mathrm{RHBI}}(D)=\frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_{u\in\{y,x\}}\mathbb E_{u}\!\left[\phi_\beta(\lVert\nabla_u D(u)\rVert_2-\kappa)^2+\lambda_{\mathrm{floor}}\lVert\nabla_u D(u)\rVert_2^2\right],\qquad \phi_\beta(s)=\frac{1}{\beta}\log\!\left(1+e^{\beta s}\right)
$$

Softly caps critic input slopes at $\kappa=1$ ($\beta=20$) and damps residual sub-unit slope chatter ($\lambda_{\mathrm{floor}}=0.005$) on real and fake endpoints without transport-chord interpolation, shape gates or an EMA critic anchor.

## Simplified pseudocode

```text
Fix one global configuration with constant learning rates and DualNorm updates across generator, encoder, critic and row-normalized particle prior.
For each task-owned training update:
  Sample real batch y and latent batch z from the task prior P; form detached fake batch x_det = stop_gradient(G(z)).
  Evaluate calibrated non-saturating logistic critic loss on D(y) and D(x_det) plus the smooth Born-Infeld endpoint input-gradient cap (with soft slope floor 0.005) on y and x_det.
  Backpropagate and step D via DualNorm; clear transient critic input-capture ring.
  With D fixed, resample latent z and compute differentiable fake batch x = G(z) together with critic forward captures.
  If continuous conditioning accompanies critic tuples D(c, x), evaluate fibre-centered paired relativistic log-odds softplus(D(c_i, y_i) - D(c_i, x_i)).
  Otherwise update detached local horizon ell_t on device from the 25th-quantile nearest-neighbor distance of y and solve K=8 deterministic log-domain Sinkhorn scaling steps for active-plus-slack coupling P*(XY) and Feydy diagonal self-coupling P*(XX).
  Evaluate the Danskin envelope RHBI generator loss combining active Born-Infeld pull, slack-routed critic ascent and Feydy self-coupling debiasing (or slack-screened relativistic log-odds on joint BiGAN hosts), plus SBNP prior regularization and any task-owned auxiliary losses.
  Project conflicting protected directions via direction-blend constraint geometry when declared, and step G, P and optional encoder E.
```

## Training details

| Characteristic | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Adversarial loss | Critic minimizes non-saturating logistic loss; unconditional and discrete-class generators minimize the RHBI slack-screened unbalanced Sinkhorn envelope objective combining physical Born-Infeld transport, Feydy diagonal self-coupling debiasing and slack-weighted centered critic log-odds ascent; continuous-conditioned fibres minimize fibre-centered paired relativistic log-odds; joint BiGAN generator/encoder hosts minimize slack-screened relativistic log-odds across active pairs and slack marginals. |
| Optimizer | Full DualNorm across generator, encoder, critic and row-normalized particle prior (zero momentum, polar smoothing 0.0061, exact CPU-LAPACK smoothed polar factor on dense 2D weights, quintic per-offset convolution rule on wide CUDA kernels, direction-blend constraint geometry) without an EMA critic copy. |
| Learning rates and annealing | Strictly constant across all tasks: global LR $0.014$, critic multiplier $1.5$ and prior multiplier $2.9$, with network and prior LR floors fixed at $1.0$ (zero schedule annealing and zero horizon dependence). |
| Parameter-gradient clipping | None on parameter tensors; active transport coordinate gradients are analytically bounded inside $[-1,+1]$ by the Born-Infeld ground cost and critic log-odds are smoothly bounded by $C_{\max}\tanh(\cdot/C_{\max})$. |
| Critic penalties and anchors | Smooth C-infinity Born-Infeld endpoint input-gradient cap evaluated on real and fake inputs ($\lambda=1$, $\kappa=1$, sharpness $\beta=20$, sub-unit slope floor $\lambda_{\mathrm{floor}}=0.005$) with zero EMA critic anchor and automatic non-concatenated evaluation on stateful batch-bound critic view wrappers. |
| Damping and update guards | None: critic spike guard ratio=$0$, latent damping=$0$, and zero shape or step-count gates; slack reservoir marginal $S=2$ keeps Sinkhorn iterations strictly inside the Birkhoff polytope while degree-of-freedom-aware SBNP regularization ($\lambda_{\mathrm{prior}}=0.02$) stabilizes particle geometry across dimensions. |
| Training and sampling noise | Zero additive critic-input or generator-output training noise ($0.0$). Task-declared prior intrinsic sigma and serving contracts are preserved unchanged. |
| Parameter averaging and serving | Generator EMA decay=$0$ and serve_average=$0$; all evaluations score live unaveraged weights. |

## Configuration differences

- RHBI uses one global trainer configuration across every Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 task without per-task tuning, step-count gates or input-shape regimes.
- When discrete class labels accompany critic inputs, cross-class active pairs are masked to minus infinity in log-Sinkhorn space so unmatched class draws route cleanly into the slack reservoir; when continuous conditioning accompanies critic tuples D(c, x), rhbi_conditional_fibre='slack' routes singleton fibres to fibre-centered paired relativistic log-odds.
- Both passive observer records and formulation critic records checkpoint ell_ema and ell_initialized with zero per-step host-device synchronizations, ensuring exact bit-for-bit continuation across restarts and rejecting incompatible checkpoints.
- Setting rhbi_weight=0.0 executes an exact zero-strength bypass that leaves horizon buffers and RNG streams untouched.

## Performance

DCGAN on deterministic mock RGB data measures finite-update speed and memory. These separate performance-source receipts confer no image-quality, scientific qualification or default-promotion credit. Standard BatchNorm is retained in generator and critic; critic input gradients therefore include batch coupling. The shared critic uses a flattened 4×4 Linear scalar head for policy feature extraction; its module layout is fixed across recipes.

Synchronized wall time for one public trainer update, including its critic/generator/prior work; warmup, construction, mock-data generation, evaluation, GIFs and checkpoint writes are excluded.

Every cell is one run; timings are never pooled across devices or contention states. Compare only rows with the same task and matched key (source, runtime/dtype, physical device, initialization and batch streams). Unknown or contended observations are unpaired. Resolution progression changes the task, while each candidate keeps one global recipe. Images/s is B divided by full update time (one D and one G/prior update with separate real batches). Three warmup and ten measured updates give short-window median/p95 measurements; long-horizon policy costs and component phase times remain unknown.

## discriminator_stability

**discriminator_stability — revision 16**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/discriminator_stability.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **11 / 18 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **2 / 7 / 1 / 15**. Its highest tier, Tier 4, has only held tests, so while they are held the view never shows PASS: a recipe that passes every counted tier gets HELD.

Calibration: **provisional**. Revision9 recipe-owned prior comparisons are provisional and require bounded calibration before scientific default adoption. Archived task declarations and gates retain their original identities.

## tier1_policy_coverage

**tier1_policy_coverage — revision 1**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/tier1_policy_coverage.json).

Separately scoped cohort. This ordinary lane retains its own required gates and execution policy; its measurements are excluded from family totals and give no parent-cohort credit.
