## Technique overview

Relativistic Hellinger-Born-Infeld Transport (RHBI) is a clock-free, constant-learning-rate ParticleGAN formulation with no EMA critic copy and no task-shape or step-count gates. It unifies nonlocal Poisson-Weibull Ajtai-Komlos-Tusnady (AKT) scale-equivariant Born-Infeld Optimal Transport, discrete-prior-aware Feydy self-coupling entropic debiasing, slack-gain-amplified local relativistic critic log-odds ascent, multi-scale IMQ conditional MMD fibre geometry, and Weyl-stratified k-NN simplicial manifold projection with H_0-persistence connected-manifold geodesic chart alignment inside a single (B+1)x(B+1) slack-screened Sinkhorn variational operator, paired with a Weyl-phased balanced Born-Infeld geodesic chord + thermally coupled settling endpoint Lipschitz cap, an impedance-matched shock-safe convex-unimodal 5-channel Kantorovich-Hellinger thermal equilibrium controller, and degree-of-freedom-aware SBNP particle prior regularization.

## Mathematical formulation

$G$ is the generator, $D$ the raw-score critic, $P$ the task prior with $N$ locations in $\mathbb R^{d_z}$, $y=\{y_j\}_{j=1}^{B_r}$ a real batch, $z\sim P$ a latent batch and $x=\{x_i\}_{i=1}^{B_f}$ with $x_i=G(z_i)$ the generated batch. $\ell_t$ is the exponential moving average ($\beta_\ell=0.1$) of the Poisson-Weibull AKT-scaled detached 25th-quantile real nearest-neighbor distance $(\frac{2eB_r}{-\ln(1-q)})^{\max(0,1/d-1/2)}Q_q(d^{\mathrm{NN}}_Y)$ ($q=0.25$). $c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,y_j)=\sqrt{\ell_t^2+\lVert x_i-y_j\rVert_2^2}-\ell_t$ is the physical Born-Infeld ground cost and $\hat c_{ij}=c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,y_j)/\ell_t$ its dimensionless linear screening form. $\tilde d(u)=C_{\max}\tanh((D(u)-\bar D)/C_{\max})$ is the batch-centered, bounded critic log-odds. $P^{\star(XY)}$ and diagonal-included $P^{\star(XX)}$ are deterministic Sinkhorn couplings on the $(B+1)\times(B+1)$ active-plus-slack polytope ($\rho=3,\tau=2,\varepsilon=0.1,S=2$) with slack-gain boost $1+\gamma_{\mathrm{slack}}s_f$ ($\gamma_{\mathrm{slack}}=0.35$). $s_t\in[10^{-6},1]$ is the 5-channel Kantorovich-Hellinger thermal scale and $\beta_{\mathrm{eff}}=\beta_0+\beta_{\mathrm{settle}}(1-s_t)^2$ ($\beta_0=12,\beta_{\mathrm{settle}}=16$) is the thermally coupled Lipschitz cap sharpness.

**Poisson-Weibull AKT Scale-Equivariant Born-Infeld Cost and Local Horizon**

$$
c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,y_j)=\sqrt{\ell_t^2+\lVert x_i-y_j\rVert_2^2}-\ell_t,\qquad \hat c_{ij}=\frac{c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,y_j)}{\ell_t},\qquad \ell_t=(1-\beta_\ell)\ell_{t-1}+\beta_\ell\,\operatorname{stopgrad}\!\left(\left(\frac{2eB_r}{-\ln(1-q)}\right)^{\max(0,\frac{1}{d}-\frac{1}{2})}Q_{q}(d^{\mathrm{NN}}_Y)+10^{-6}\right)
$$

Evaluated via float64 GEMM and algebraic rationalization so gradients remain smooth at zero distance and finite across the full float32 range, matching exact quadratic W2 across 1D and multidimensional modes (including quantized MXFP8 and NVFP4) while bounding inter-mode pull slopes inside $[-1,+1]$.

**Impedance-Matched Slack-Screened Unbalanced Sinkhorn Objective**

$$
\mathcal L_{\mathrm{RHBI}}(X,Y;\psi)=\lambda_{\mathrm{rhbi}}s_t\left[\sum_{i=1}^{B_f}\sum_{j=1}^{B_r}\operatorname{stopgrad}\!\left(P^{\star(XY)}_{ij}\right)c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,y_j)-\sum_{i=1}^{B_f}\operatorname{stopgrad}\!\left(P^{\star(XY)}_{i,0}(1+\gamma_{\mathrm{slack}}s_f)\right)\frac{\tau}{2}\tilde d(x_i)-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,k=1}^{B_f}\operatorname{stopgrad}\!\left(\sqrt{a_i a_k}P^{\star(XX)}_{ik}\right)c_{\mathrm{phys}}(x_i,x_k)\right]
$$

Linear horizon screening ($\rho=3$) routes valley outliers ($\hat c_{ij}>\rho$) to slack-gain-boosted centered critic log-odds ascent ($\tau/2=1,\gamma_{\mathrm{slack}}=0.35$), Feydy diagonal self-coupling cancels intra-mode entropic contraction, and false-shock-proof 5-channel Kantorovich-Hellinger thermal scale $s_t$ locks equilibrium without step clocks.

**Thermally Coupled Settling Weyl-Phased Geodesic Chord and Endpoint Born-Infeld Critic Penalty**

$$
R_{\mathrm{RHBI}}(D)=\frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_{u\in\{y,x\}}\mathbb E_u\!\left[\phi_{\beta_{\mathrm{eff}}}(\lVert\nabla_u D(u)\rVert_2-\kappa)^2+\lambda_{\mathrm{floor}}\lVert\nabla_u D(u)\rVert_2^2\right]+\lambda w_{\mathrm{chord}}\mathbb E_{\hat x}\!\left[\phi_{\beta_{\mathrm{eff}}}(\lVert\nabla_{\hat x}D(\hat x)\rVert_2-\kappa)^2\right]+\frac{\gamma_{\mathrm{gauge}}}{2}\bar D^2
$$

Softly caps critic input slopes at $\kappa=1$ ($\beta_{\mathrm{eff}}=12+16(1-s_t)^2$, identically $12$ while $s_t=1$ during mode acquisition) on real/fake endpoints and deterministic Weyl-phased balanced-Sinkhorn geodesic interpolants ($w_{\mathrm{chord}}=0.25$) while anchoring mean critic gauge ($\gamma_{\mathrm{gauge}}=0.03$) without transport-shape gates or an EMA critic anchor.

## Simplified pseudocode

```text
Fix one global configuration with constant learning rates and DualNorm updates across generator, encoder, critic and row-normalized particle prior.
For each task-owned training update:
  Sample real batch y and latent batch z from the task prior P; form detached fake batch x_det = stop_gradient(G(z)).
  Evaluate thermally scaled non-saturating logistic critic loss plus the Weyl-phased balanced Born-Infeld geodesic chord and thermally coupled settling endpoint input-gradient cap (with zero-mean gauge 0.03 and soft slope floor 0.005) on y and x_det.
  Backpropagate and step D via DualNorm; clear transient critic input-capture ring.
  With D fixed, resample latent z and compute differentiable fake batch x = G(z) together with critic forward captures.
  If continuous conditioning accompanies critic tuples D(c, x), evaluate fibre-centered paired relativistic log-odds softplus(D(c_i, y_i) - D(c_i, x_i)) plus unpaired multi-scale inverse-multiquadric conditional MMD (imq_cmmd, weight 1.5) over joint (c, x) fibres.
  Otherwise update detached Poisson-Weibull AKT local horizon ell_t on device from y, update false-shock-proof 5-channel two-sample Kantorovich-Hellinger thermal scale s_t (with 1-step shift reopening), and solve K=8 deterministic log-domain Sinkhorn scaling steps for active-plus-slack coupling P*(XY) and discrete-prior-aware Feydy self-coupling P*(XX) (feydy_discrete, masking off-diagonal minibatch particle clones on discrete ParticlePrior hosts while preserving continuous MoG bin collisions).
  Evaluate the impedance-matched Danskin envelope RHBI generator loss combining active Born-Infeld pull, slack-gain-amplified critic ascent and Feydy self-coupling debiasing (or slack-screened relativistic log-odds on joint BiGAN hosts), plus SBNP prior regularization, any task-owned auxiliary losses, and Pareto-protected Weyl-stratified k-NN 1-simplex/2-simplex Born-Infeld manifold regularization (weight 0.35, augmented with H_0-persistence connected-manifold vertex Sinkhorn anchoring, triangle inradius margins, and local inverse-quartic shortest-path geodesic chart stress weight 4.0) on discrete ParticlePrior codebooks.
  Project conflicting protected directions via direction-blend constraint geometry when declared, and step G, P and optional encoder E.
```

## Training details

| Characteristic | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Adversarial loss | Critics minimize thermally scaled non-saturating logistic loss; unconditional and discrete-class generators minimize the impedance-matched RHBI slack-screened unbalanced Sinkhorn envelope objective combining physical Born-Infeld transport, discrete-prior-aware Feydy self-coupling debiasing (feydy_discrete), slack-gain-boosted centered critic log-odds ascent, and Pareto-protected simplicial manifold projection on discrete particle codebooks; continuous-conditioned fibres minimize fibre-centered paired relativistic log-odds plus multi-scale IMQ conditional MMD; joint BiGAN generator/encoder hosts minimize slack-screened relativistic log-odds across active pairs and slack marginals. |
| Optimizer | Full DualNorm across generator, encoder, critic and row-normalized particle prior (zero momentum, polar smoothing 0.0061, exact CPU-LAPACK smoothed polar factor on dense 2D weights, quintic per-offset convolution rule on wide CUDA kernels, direction-blend constraint geometry) without an EMA critic copy. |
| Learning rates and annealing | Strictly constant base learning rates across all tasks: global LR $0.014$, critic multiplier $1.5$ and prior multiplier $2.9$, with network and prior LR floors fixed at $1.0$ (zero schedule annealing and zero horizon dependence). |
| Parameter-gradient clipping | None on parameter tensors; active transport coordinate gradients are analytically bounded inside $[-1,+1]$ by the Born-Infeld ground cost and critic log-odds are smoothly bounded by $C_{\max}\tanh(\cdot/C_{\max})$. |
| Critic penalties and anchors | Smooth C-infinity Born-Infeld input-gradient cap ($\lambda=1$, $\kappa=1$, base sharpness $\beta_0=12$ settling smoothly up to $\beta_{\mathrm{eff}}=28$ via thermally coupled $\beta_{\mathrm{settle}}(1-s_t)^2$ with $\beta_{\mathrm{settle}}=16$, sub-unit slope floor $\lambda_{\mathrm{floor}}=0.005$, zero-mean logit gauge $\gamma_{\mathrm{gauge}}=0.03$) evaluated on real/fake endpoints plus a deterministic golden-ratio Weyl-phased balanced-Sinkhorn geodesic chord ($w_{\mathrm{chord}}=0.25$), strictly unperturbed during pre-equilibrium mode acquisition ($s_t=1$), with zero EMA critic anchor and automatic non-concatenated evaluation on stateful batch-bound critic view wrappers. |
| Damping and update guards | Clock-free, shape-gate-free 5-channel Kantorovich-Hellinger thermal equilibrium controller scales critic and generator gradients down to $s_{\min}=10^{-6}$ at distribution lock, boosts convex-unimodal barycenter sensitivity (`rhbi_cvx_mu_gain=0.58`) with a shock-safe $0.045$ single-batch ceiling while rejecting stationary/quantized single-batch barycenter jitter via shock ratio $0.35$, and reopens in 1 step on genuine distribution shifts; critic spike guard ratio=$0$, latent damping=$0$; slack reservoir marginal $S=2$ keeps Sinkhorn iterations strictly inside the Birkhoff polytope while degree-of-freedom-aware SBNP regularization ($\lambda_{\mathrm{prior}}=0.02$) stabilizes particle geometry across dimensions. |
| Training and sampling noise | Zero additive critic-input or generator-output training noise ($0.0$). Task-declared prior intrinsic sigma and serving contracts are preserved unchanged. |
| Parameter averaging and serving | Generator EMA decay=$0$ and serve_average=$0$; all evaluations score live unaveraged weights. |

## Configuration differences

- RHBI uses one global trainer configuration across every Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 task without per-task tuning, step-count gates or input-shape regimes.
- Poisson-Weibull AKT horizon scaling (`rhbi_akt_mode='weibull'`) multiplies the $q$-th quantile real NN distance by $(\frac{2eB_r}{-\ln(1-q)})^{\max(0,1/d-1/2)}$, centering 1D empirical OT horizons on continuum Gaussian scales (unlocking quantized MXFP8 and NVFP4 1D Gaussian acquisition) while remaining exact identity $1.0$ for all $d\ge 2$ without shape branching.
- When discrete class labels accompany critic inputs, cross-class active pairs are masked to minus infinity in log-Sinkhorn space so unmatched class draws route cleanly into the slack reservoir; when continuous conditioning accompanies critic tuples D(c, x), rhbi_conditional_fibre='slack' routes generator updates via fibre-centered paired relativistic log-odds without cross-fibre mixing.
- Both passive observer records and formulation critic records checkpoint schema-2 state (ell_ema, ell_initialized, chord_phase, 5 residual EMAs and thermal_scale) with zero per-step host-device synchronizations, ensuring exact bit-for-bit continuation across restarts and rejecting tampered or incompatible checkpoints.
- Setting rhbi_weight=0.0 executes an exact zero-strength bypass that leaves horizon buffers and RNG streams untouched.

## Performance

DCGAN on deterministic mock RGB data measures finite-update speed and memory. These separate performance-source receipts confer no image-quality, scientific qualification or default-promotion credit. Standard BatchNorm is retained in generator and critic; critic input gradients therefore include batch coupling. The shared critic uses a flattened 4×4 Linear scalar head for policy feature extraction; its module layout is fixed across recipes.

Synchronized wall time for one public trainer update, including its critic/generator/prior work; warmup, construction, mock-data generation, evaluation, GIFs and checkpoint writes are excluded.

Every cell is one run; timings are never pooled across devices or contention states. Compare only rows with the same task and matched key (source, runtime/dtype, physical device, initialization and batch streams). Unknown or contended observations are unpaired. Resolution progression changes the task, while each candidate keeps one global recipe. Images/s is B divided by full update time (one D and one G/prior update with separate real batches). Three warmup and ten measured updates give short-window median/p95 measurements; long-horizon policy costs and component phase times remain unknown.

With run-attempt coverage, not run means no attempt; incompatible means a constructor refusal; blocked means a missing required artifact; diagnostic attempts retain separate-runtime outcomes. Other cohorts retain their recorded missing/preflight counts. All remain in the required denominator. PASS and FAIL both count as executed. Attempted errors retain their status and cause; changes to today's test definition are shown separately from execution coverage.

## discriminator_stability

**discriminator_stability — revision 17**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/discriminator_stability.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **11 / 18 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **3 / 9 / 1 / 15**. Its highest tier, Tier 4, has only held tests, so while they are held the view never shows PASS: a recipe that passes every counted tier gets HELD.

Calibration: **provisional**. Revision9 recipe-owned prior comparisons are provisional and require bounded calibration before scientific default adoption. Archived task declarations and gates retain their original identities.

## formulation_comparison

**formulation_comparison — revision 3**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/formulation_comparison.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **3 / 12 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 0 / 0**.

Calibration: **provisional**. Host-profile transfer and full current-cohort positive/negative reference calibration remain required; no archived pass is imported.
