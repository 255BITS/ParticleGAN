## Technique overview

The released v0.7 GAN v3 family uses paired relativistic logistic loss with a fixed L2 cap on critic input gradients, plus latent spread regularization and a full-horizon cosine LR schedule. Its K3P-derived optimizer wrappers have the spike guard, anchor, A2 and direct-particle gain disabled. Forge's reusable card delegates host resources and auxiliary objectives explicitly; the historical MoG and cloud host cards retain their separate identities.

## Mathematical formulation

$G$ is the generator, $D$ the raw-score critic, $P$ the task prior, $x$ a real batch, $z\sim P$ a latent batch and $y$ the generated batch, including any declared output noise. $C$ is the critic actually evaluated: $C=D$ without input noise; otherwise every forward evaluates $D(u+\epsilon_{\mathrm{in}})$ with a fresh draw. $\mathbb E$ means a sample mean, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is the Euclidean norm, $(a)_+=\max(a,0)$ and $\operatorname{softplus}(a)=\log(1+e^a)$. The scalar sketch detaches $y$ during the critic update and resamples differentiable $y$ after that update; joint and auxiliary hosts retain task-owned objectives. $g_r=\nabla_x C(x)$ and $g_f=\nabla_y C(y)$ are per-sample input gradients; $d$ counts critic-input coordinates. $\lambda$ is penalty strength and $\kappa$ the cap threshold. $R_{\mathrm{prior}}$ is the VICReg-inspired latent spread term, $d_z$ the latent dimension, $\Sigma_z$ the unbiased sample covariance and $\epsilon=10^{-4}$ the variance stabilizer. $t$ counts completed updates, $T$ is the declared recipe horizon, $q=t/T$, $\eta^{(0)}$ a base LR and $a(q)$ its multiplier. EMA denotes a parameter exponential moving average.

**Default paired adversarial loss**

$$
\begin{aligned}\ell_D&=\mathbb E\!\left[\operatorname{softplus}(C(y)-C(x))\right],\\\ell_G&=\mathbb E\!\left[\operatorname{softplus}(C(x)-C(y))\right].\end{aligned}
$$

These scalar losses are minimized. The critic objective is $\ell_D+R$; the generator adds only its declared auxiliary objectives. Critic fakes are detached, and generator fakes and both scores are recomputed after the critic step. $C$ includes any declared fresh input noise.

**Fixed capped input-gradient penalty**

$$
R_{\mathrm{BCAP}}=\frac{\lambda}{2}\left\{\mathbb E\!\left[(\lVert g_r\rVert_2-\kappa)_+^2\right]+\mathbb E\!\left[(\lVert g_f\rVert_2-\kappa)_+^2\right]\right\}.
$$

The full release recipe fixes $\lambda=6$ and $\kappa=1.25$, applied every critic update. This is the same soft L2 cap mechanism with stronger and wider settings; K3P handover, critic proximity and optimizer interventions are disabled.

**Latent spread auxiliary objective**

$$
\begin{aligned}R_{\mathrm{prior}}&=\frac{1}{d_z}\sum_{a=1}^{d_z}\left(1-\sqrt{(\Sigma_z)_{aa}+10^{-4}}\right)_+\\&\quad+\frac{1}{d_z}\sum_{a\ne b}(\Sigma_z)_{ab}^2,\\L_G&=\ell_G+0.05R_{\mathrm{prior}}.\end{aligned}
$$

For scalar hosts that expose this auxiliary, use the unbiased sample covariance of the supplied latent batch. It discourages standard deviations below $1$ and off-diagonal covariance, without requiring a Gaussian topology. Batches with fewer than two rows return zero. Behavioral hosts retain their explicitly bound auxiliary objectives.

**Full-horizon learning-rate cosine**

$$
a(q)=\begin{cases}1,&q\le0.6,\\0.05+\dfrac{0.95}{2}\left[1+\cos\!\left(\pi\min\!\left(1,\dfrac{q-0.6}{0.4}\right)\right)\right],&q>0.6,\end{cases}\qquad \eta(t)=\eta^{(0)}a(t/T).
$$

Hold each role at its base rate for $60\%$ of the declared recipe horizon, then decay to a $5\%$ floor and hold. The reusable task-adapted card resolves $T$ explicitly; the historical native MoG/cloud cards retain $T=7000$. An external execution cap does not redefine the schedule.

## Simplified pseudocode

```text
For each training iteration:
  Use the resolved task horizon: hold LR through 60%, then cosine-decay toward 5% of its base value.
  Draw real x and task-prior z; fake = detach(G(z)).
  Compute the paired critic adversarial loss shown above.
  g_r = gradient(D(x),x); g_f = gradient(D(fake),fake), using detached input copies.
  Add the fixed real/fake input-gradient penalty shown above.
  Backpropagate; take the critic Adam step with guard and gradient anchor disabled.
  Freeze D parameters; draw fresh z, regenerate fake and recompute both scores.
  Compute the paired generator adversarial loss from the updated critic.
  On scalar latent-table hosts, add .05 * R_prior to L_G; behavioral hosts retain their original objectives.
  Backpropagate; update G/prior with A2 and direct response gain disabled.
  Maintain the configured .995 generator/prior EMA where the host implements it.
  Score with the frozen task's declared weights, prior and noise law; ordinary gates use clean live outputs.
```

## Training details

| Characteristic | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Adversarial loss | Paired relativistic logistic, with the fixed real/fake cap regularizer below. Scalar hosts add the declared $0.05$ latent variance/covariance term; behavioral hosts keep their task-owned reconstruction, conditional or direct-particle objectives. |
| Optimizer | K3P-derived Adam wrappers selected by the explicit fixed b_cap arm. $\beta_1=0$, $\beta_2=0.99$, AMSGrad off; guard, anchor, A2 and direct gain are disabled. Observer bookkeeping remains. This recipe is not selected through optimizer_family='adam', despite having its intervention switches off. Direct sample-particle hosts can retain separately declared response moments even when response gain is disabled; inspect the host binding. |
| Learning rates and annealing | Reference base LR $0.00425$, critic multiplier $1$, latent-prior multiplier $2$; full resolved horizon, $60\%$ hold followed by cosine decay to $5\%$, with no separate short network horizon. The current selected whole variant uses $0.006375$ and prior multiplier $1$. Task-adapted fields delegate the horizon explicitly; an external cap does not redefine it. |
| Parameter-gradient clipping | No critic spike guard or global gradient-norm clipping. The cap penalizes excess critic input-gradient magnitude in the loss; it does not clamp critic parameter gradients or weights. |
| Critic penalties and anchors | Fixed $\lambda=6$ and L2 cap $\kappa=1.25$ on both real and fake samples, applied every step. No RMS normalization, K3P handover or critic-gradient proximity term. |
| Damping and update guards | A2, critic spike guard, critic anchor and direct sample-particle gain are all disabled. This distinguishes the full release recipe from a fixed BCap penalty swapped into an otherwise intact K3P recipe. |
| Training and sampling noise | No additive critic-input or generated-output training noise. The task's prior still owns its latent sampling noise: learned-MoG and particle-cloud hosts remain distinct. Paired noisy/EMA diagnostics do not replace the required clean/live result. |
| Parameter averaging and serving | Generator/prior EMA decay $0.995$ is configured where the host implements it; selected ordinary gates use live weights. Behavioral hosts may own no scored EMA or latent table. No critic-gradient anchor average is active. |

## Configuration differences

- Each result retains its executed source, recipe, task prior, initialization, budget and sampling law. These descriptions do not change or requalify recorded measurements.
- Task-owned objectives and active components matter: direct sample particles, learned latent rows and a generator network are different parameter roles. A declared recipe switch does not imply that every host can apply it.
- The canonical release07-gan-v3-task-adapted-v1 delegates only declared task resources/objectives. Its reference recipe uses LR .00425/prior multiplier 2. The selected release07-gan-v3-mog--1e266b5a2986ee4cb2f2fdc46437cc82982bf1cf02707eeba95743f4890e8a0c at source 928b485ffbe6e17d79b41d307ae8b6275489b37a uses .006375/prior multiplier 1.
- Historical release07-gan-v3-mog and release07-gan-v3-cloud entries are retained host/source cohorts, not additional current solution families. They cannot fill selected-row cells.
- The .05 scalar spread coefficient multiplies a variance/covariance helper, not the complete VICReg self-supervised objective. Task-owned direct-particle hosts instead retain their original objective and parameter roles.

## Performance

DCGAN on deterministic mock RGB data measures finite-update speed and memory. These separate performance-source receipts confer no image-quality, scientific qualification or default-promotion credit. Standard BatchNorm is retained in generator and critic; critic input gradients therefore include batch coupling. The shared critic uses a flattened 4×4 Linear scalar head for policy feature extraction; its module layout is fixed across recipes.

Synchronized wall time for one public trainer update, including its critic/generator/prior work; warmup, construction, mock-data generation, evaluation, GIFs and checkpoint writes are excluded.

Every cell is one run; timings are never pooled across devices or contention states. Compare only rows with the same task and matched key (source, runtime/dtype, physical device, initialization and batch streams). Unknown or contended observations are unpaired. Resolution progression changes the task, while each candidate keeps one global recipe. Images/s is B divided by full update time (one D and one G/prior update with separate real batches). Three warmup and ten measured updates give short-window median/p95 measurements; long-horizon policy costs and component phase times remain unknown.

## discriminator_stability

**discriminator_stability — revision 14**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/discriminator_stability.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **11 / 18 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 1 / 14**. Its highest tier, Tier 4, has only held tests, so while they are held the view never shows PASS: a recipe that passes every counted tier gets HELD.

Calibration: **provisional**. Revision9 recipe-owned prior comparisons are provisional and require bounded calibration before scientific default adoption. Archived task declarations and gates retain their original identities.

## quality_coverage

**quality_coverage — revision 4**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/quality_coverage.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **3 / 12 / 0 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 0 / 0**.

Calibration: **provisional**. Phase D historical calibration remains required

Recorded qualification: **tier 0**, discriminator_stability revision 9. Other view rows below are navigation over recorded task evidence, not recomputed qualification. Their counts follow the declared view revisions (adaptation 4, clockfree_continuous 5, discriminator_stability 14, formulation_comparison 3, host_profile_transfer 6, quality_coverage 4); the recorded qualification keeps discriminator_stability revision 9 until new ordinary evidence is registered.

With run-attempt coverage, not run means no attempt; incompatible means a constructor refusal; blocked means a missing required artifact; diagnostic attempts retain separate-runtime outcomes. Other cohorts retain their recorded missing/preflight counts. All remain in the required denominator. PASS and FAIL both count as executed. Attempted errors retain their status and cause; changes to today's test definition are shown separately from execution coverage.

## dcgan_performance_cpu_smoke

**dcgan_performance_cpu_smoke — revision 1**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/dcgan_performance_cpu_smoke.json).

Diagnostic-only view; its outcomes are excluded from the family totals and grant no qualification.

Calibration: **undeclared**. Calibration and robustness are separate from recorded task passes.

## discriminator_stability

**discriminator_stability — revision 14**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/discriminator_stability.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **11 / 18 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 1 / 14**. Its highest tier, Tier 4, has only held tests, so while they are held the view never shows PASS: a recipe that passes every counted tier gets HELD.

Calibration: **provisional**. Revision9 recipe-owned prior comparisons are provisional and require bounded calibration before scientific default adoption. Archived task declarations and gates retain their original identities.

## host_profile_transfer

**host_profile_transfer — revision 6**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/host_profile_transfer.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **3 / 12 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 0 / 0**.

Calibration: **provisional**. Host-profile transfer and full current-cohort positive/negative reference calibration remain required; no archived pass is imported.

## quality_coverage

**quality_coverage — revision 4**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/quality_coverage.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **3 / 12 / 0 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 0 / 0**.

Calibration: **provisional**. Phase D historical calibration remains required

With run-attempt coverage, not run means no attempt; incompatible means a constructor refusal; blocked means a missing required artifact; diagnostic attempts retain separate-runtime outcomes. Other cohorts retain their recorded missing/preflight counts. All remain in the required denominator. PASS and FAIL both count as executed. Attempted errors retain their status and cause; changes to today's test definition are shown separately from execution coverage.

## discriminator_stability

**discriminator_stability — revision 14**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/discriminator_stability.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **11 / 18 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 1 / 14**. Its highest tier, Tier 4, has only held tests, so while they are held the view never shows PASS: a recipe that passes every counted tier gets HELD.

Calibration: **provisional**. Revision9 recipe-owned prior comparisons are provisional and require bounded calibration before scientific default adoption. Archived task declarations and gates retain their original identities.

## lazy_cadence_coverage

**lazy_cadence_coverage — revision 1**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/lazy_cadence_coverage.json).

Separately scoped cohort. This ordinary lane retains its own required gates and execution policy; its measurements are excluded from family totals and give no parent-cohort credit.

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **0 / 0 / 0 / 0**.

Calibration: **undeclared**. Calibration and robustness are separate from recorded task passes.
