## Technique overview

BCAP adds a fixed critic penalty whenever the input-gradient norm exceeds a threshold, evaluated separately on real and generated data. This high-level formulation defines the family. Adam, normalized-gradient and DualNorm optimizers, learning rates, momentum and loss settings are configuration choices. The current benchmark uses the explicitly selected winning DualNorm recipe. Historical BCAP-with-K3P formulations and optimizer alternatives retain their complete, separate evidence below.

Conceptual illustration of the BCAP critic-loss mechanism, not measured training results. Generator/prior updates are described below.

## Mathematical formulation

$G$ is the generator, $D$ the raw-score critic, $P$ the task prior, $x$ a real batch, $z\sim P$ a latent batch and $y$ the generated batch, including any declared output noise. $C$ is the critic actually evaluated: $C=D$ without input noise; otherwise every forward evaluates $D(u+\epsilon_{\mathrm{in}})$ with a fresh draw. $\mathbb E$ means a sample mean, $\lVert\cdot\rVert_2$ is the Euclidean norm, $(a)_+=\max(a,0)$ and $\operatorname{softplus}(a)=\log(1+e^a)$. The scalar sketch detaches $y$ during the critic update and resamples differentiable $y$ after that update; joint and auxiliary hosts retain task-owned objectives. $g_r=\nabla_x C(x)$ and $g_f=\nabla_y C(y)$ are per-sample input gradients; $d$ counts critic-input coordinates. $\lambda$ is penalty strength and $\kappa$ the cap threshold. $\eta_0$ is the global base LR, $m_D$ and $m_P$ the role multipliers. A joint host also has an encoder $E$, whose adversarial objective must train both joint critic streams.

**Default paired adversarial loss**

$$
\begin{aligned}\ell_D&=\mathbb E\!\left[\operatorname{softplus}(C(y)-C(x))\right],\\\ell_G&=\mathbb E\!\left[\operatorname{softplus}(C(x)-C(y))\right].\end{aligned}
$$

These scalar losses are minimized. The critic objective is $\ell_D+R$; the generator adds only its declared auxiliary objectives. Critic fakes are detached, and generator fakes and both scores are recomputed after the critic step. $C$ includes any declared fresh input noise. This equation is the canonical paired-loss example; non-saturating, hinge, Wasserstein and least-squares options keep their own loss formulas, and joint hosts use their explicit generator/encoder objective.

**Fixed capped input-gradient penalty**

$$
R_{\mathrm{BCAP}}=\frac{\lambda}{2}\left\{\mathbb E\!\left[(\lVert g_r\rVert_2-\kappa)_+^2\right]+\mathbb E\!\left[(\lVert g_f\rVert_2-\kappa)_+^2\right]\right\}.
$$

The cap is a soft loss penalty on real and fake critic input-gradient norms, without division by input dimension. It does not directly clip critic parameter gradients or weights. The canonical BCAP cards use $\lambda=1$ and $\kappa=1$; source-bound selected recipes may differ.

## Simplified pseudocode

```text
Choose an adversarial loss, optimizer and its configuration.
For each task-owned training update:
  Sample real x and latent z from the task prior P; compute y=G(z).
  Critic objective = adversarial_D(D(x), D(stop_gradient(y))) + fixed BCAP penalty.
  Compute BCAP from real and fake input-gradient norms; the penalty updates D only.
  Backpropagate the critic objective and step D using the configured optimizer.
  With D fixed, recompute differentiable fake samples and scores.
  Backpropagate adversarial_G plus task-owned auxiliary objectives.
  Step G, trainable prior P and encoder E when present using their configured rates.
  Joint encoder/generator hosts reverse labels on both critic streams.
```

## Training details

| Characteristic | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Adversarial loss | Selectable paired relativistic logistic (canonical/default), non-saturating logistic, hinge, Wasserstein or least squares. The scalar losses are minimized. Relativistic $D$: $\mathbb E[\operatorname{softplus}(C(y)-C(x))]$; $G$ reverses the difference. Joint hosts use the explicit generator/encoder objective. |
| Optimizer | Native PyTorch Adam. Canonical $\beta_1=0$, $\beta_2=0.999$ and $\varepsilon=10^{-8}$; moments are constant. |
| Learning rates and annealing | Constant: canonical global LR $0.00425$, D multiplier $1$ and prior multiplier $2$. The measured round also tested global LR $0.0010625$. Network and prior LR floors are $1$, so the scheduled API path performs no annealing. |
| Parameter-gradient clipping | None. Critic spike guard is disabled; BCAP acts through the loss, not parameter-gradient clipping. |
| Critic penalties and anchors | Fixed real/fake one-sided squared L2 cap. Canonical $\lambda=1$, $\kappa=1$, applied every critic update. No K3P early/late blend or critic-anchor term. |
| Damping and update guards | No A2 latent-row damping, direct-particle response gain, or adaptive critic step intervention. |
| Training and sampling noise | No additive critic-input or generator-output training noise. Sampling noise inherent to a task-declared MoG prior remains part of that prior, not an extra BCAP intervention. |
| Parameter averaging and serving | Canonical generator EMA decay=$0$ and no critic-anchor penalty; the reported round scores clean live weights. |

## Configuration differences

- The fixed capped input-gradient penalty defines BCAP. Optimizer choice, learning rates, momentum, numerical floors and adversarial-loss settings stay within this solution family.
- The selected configuration table reports the executed trainer recipe. Task-owned architecture, initialization, prior, sampling, update budget and auxiliary objectives remain bound to each experiment.
- One whole recorded configuration supplies every displayed result. Passing cells from different recipes or sources are never combined.
- The cap is a soft loss penalty on critic input gradients, not a hard bound on parameter gradients. The L2 norm is not divided by input dimension.
- Corrected joint-host candidates use both generator and encoder adversarial terms. Earlier incompatible receipts preserve their original source and verdicts.
- BCAP with K3P retains its additional K3P training mechanisms and is reported as a separate formulation.
- The opt-in per-offset DualNorm convolution extension completes the four previously unsupported image tasks, but all four sustained gates fail. This separate source-bound diagnostic retains constant learning rates and does not replace the selected configuration or original Tier 2 setup errors. See [the convolution readout](../bcap-convolution/README.md).

## Performance

DCGAN on deterministic mock RGB data measures finite-update speed and memory. These separate performance-source receipts confer no image-quality, scientific qualification or default-promotion credit. Standard BatchNorm is retained in generator and critic; critic input gradients therefore include batch coupling. The shared critic uses a flattened 4×4 Linear scalar head for policy feature extraction; its module layout is fixed across recipes.

Synchronized wall time for one public trainer update, including its critic/generator/prior work; warmup, construction, mock-data generation, evaluation, GIFs and checkpoint writes are excluded.

Every cell is one run; timings are never pooled across devices or contention states. Compare only rows with the same task and matched key (source, runtime/dtype, physical device, initialization and batch streams). Unknown or contended observations are unpaired. Resolution progression changes the task, while each candidate keeps one global recipe. Images/s is B divided by full update time (one D and one G/prior update with separate real batches). Three warmup and ten measured updates give short-window median/p95 measurements; long-horizon policy costs and component phase times remain unknown.

This registration covers 8 complete recipes. Historical alternatives outside its registered family roster add no missing benchmark cells. A changed selected recipe within a registered family remains unknown until measured.

No current selected-recipe update timings are measured. Missing timing cells remain **unknown**.

## discriminator_stability

**discriminator_stability — revision 14**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/discriminator_stability.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **13 / 16 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 1 / 5**. Its highest tier, Tier 4, has only held tests, so while they are held the view never shows PASS: a recipe that passes every counted tier gets HELD.

Calibration: **provisional**. Revision9 recipe-owned prior comparisons are provisional and require bounded calibration before scientific default adoption. Archived task declarations and gates retain their original identities.

## quality_coverage

**quality_coverage — revision 4**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/quality_coverage.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **3 / 12 / 0 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 0 / 0**.

Calibration: **provisional**. Phase D historical calibration remains required

With run-attempt coverage, not run means no attempt; incompatible means a constructor refusal; blocked means a missing required artifact; diagnostic attempts retain separate-runtime outcomes. Other cohorts retain their recorded missing/preflight counts. All remain in the required denominator. PASS and FAIL both count as executed. Attempted errors retain their status and cause; changes to today's test definition are shown separately from execution coverage.

## discriminator_stability

**discriminator_stability — revision 14**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/discriminator_stability.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **13 / 16 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 1 / 5**. Its highest tier, Tier 4, has only held tests, so while they are held the view never shows PASS: a recipe that passes every counted tier gets HELD.

Calibration: **provisional**. Revision9 recipe-owned prior comparisons are provisional and require bounded calibration before scientific default adoption. Archived task declarations and gates retain their original identities.

## tier1_policy_coverage

**tier1_policy_coverage — revision 1**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/tier1_policy_coverage.json).

Separately scoped cohort. This ordinary lane retains its own required gates and execution policy; its measurements are excluded from family totals and give no parent-cohort credit.

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **7 / 0 / 0 / 0**.

Calibration: **undeclared**. Calibration and robustness are separate from recorded task passes.
