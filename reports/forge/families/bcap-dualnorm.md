## Technique overview

BCAP with public Recipe.optimizer_family=dualnorm. The focused study changes only the optimizer rule and its rates from current pure BCAP. It retains the relativistic objective, fixed real/fake cap penalty and each task-owned auxiliary objective. Outcomes remain pending until compatible ordinary receipts are measured.

## Simplified pseudocode

G is the generator, E an encoder when present, D the critic, P the task-declared prior, g the loss gradient, m a momentum buffer, mu its coefficient, eta_P the player step size and epsilon the numerical floor. G and E share one player for global normalization. All updates descend their existing public losses.

```text
For each unchanged task update:
  Compute the existing critic loss plus fixed BCAP penalty; backpropagate D.
  Apply the selected optimizer rule to D.
  Compute the existing G/E/prior loss through the updated critic, retaining task auxiliary terms.
  Record actual G-sampled prior rows when the selected optimizer consumes a row mask.
  Apply the selected optimizer rule to G/E/prior.
  Apply the existing schedule multiplier and score with the frozen task sampling/evaluation law.
Selected rule: For matrix weights, use momentum m=mu*m+g and the polar update sqrt(max(1, fan_out/fan_in))*polar(m). Normalize bias/vector momentum per tensor. Skip matrix gradients below epsilon. Sampled prior rows receive independent normalized-gradient steps with no momentum; unsampled rows do not move. No Adam components.
```

## Training details

| Characteristic | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Adversarial loss | Current BCAP paired relativistic logistic; joint hosts retain their explicit two-stream generator/encoder objective and existing auxiliary terms. |
| Optimizer | For matrix weights, use momentum m=mu*m+g and the polar update sqrt(max(1, fan_out/fan_in))*polar(m). Normalize bias/vector momentum per tensor. Skip matrix gradients below epsilon. Sampled prior rows receive independent normalized-gradient steps with no momentum; unsampled rows do not move. No Adam components. |
| Learning rates and annealing | etaG in {0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1}, D/G=1.5, absolute etaPrior=0.03. Positive mu in {0.5, 0.9}; mu=0 has a separate structural base/search. The BCAP baseline schedule has network/prior floors 1, so its declared schedule multiplier stays constant; changing the optimizer does not change that shape. |
| Parameter-gradient clipping | No added parameter-gradient clipping. Normalization defines the optimizer step; the existing BCAP term remains a loss penalty on critic input gradients. |
| Critic penalties and anchors | Unchanged b_cap coefficient 1 and cap 1, applied to real/fake L2 input-gradient norms; no added critic anchor. |
| Damping and update guards | Existing BCAP disables A2, direct-particle gain and critic spike guard; no replacement intervention is introduced. |
| Training and sampling noise | Zero additive training input/output noise. Task-declared prior sampling, named streams and data batches remain unchanged. |
| Parameter averaging and serving | Current BCAP EMA decay 0 and live serving/scoring; this focused study does not substitute the pasted historical EMA/cosine example recipe. |

## Configuration differences

- The initial optimizer campaign has exactly 41 whole recipes and reserves 103320 seconds (2520 per recipe); every recipe retains all six required Tier 1 tasks plus the existing diagnostic.
- Each candidate uses one global configuration across tasks, protocol seed 0 and the public deterministic initializer. Independent runnable current-tier peers finish despite another required failure.
- No measured result or qualification is inferred from these mechanism descriptions. Existing task failures, archived source cohorts and the incumbent remain intact.
- Five-seed inference, the R1/R2 axis, native examples and width/depth transfer are deferred by the focused study scope; P1-P6 cannot be statistically falsified by this screen.
- Consult the single current goal leaderboard reports/forge/technique-inventory.md and the registered search for compatible measured results.

## Performance

DCGAN on deterministic mock RGB data measures finite-update speed and memory. These separate performance-source receipts confer no image-quality, scientific qualification or default-promotion credit. Standard BatchNorm is retained in generator and critic; critic input gradients therefore include batch coupling. The shared critic uses a flattened 4×4 Linear scalar head for policy feature extraction; its module layout is fixed across recipes.

Synchronized wall time for one public trainer update, including its critic/generator/prior work; warmup, construction, mock-data generation, evaluation, GIFs and checkpoint writes are excluded.

Every cell is one run; timings are never pooled across devices or contention states. Compare only rows with the same task and matched key (source, runtime/dtype, physical device, initialization and batch streams). Unknown or contended observations are unpaired. Resolution progression changes the task, while each candidate keeps one global recipe. Images/s is B divided by full update time (one D and one G/prior update with separate real batches). Three warmup and ten measured updates give short-window median/p95 measurements; long-horizon policy costs and component phase times remain unknown.

## discriminator_stability

**discriminator_stability — revision 14**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/discriminator_stability.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **13 / 16 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 1 / 5**. Its highest tier, Tier 4, has only held tests, so while they are held the view never shows PASS: a recipe that passes every counted tier gets HELD.

Calibration: **provisional**. Revision9 recipe-owned prior comparisons are provisional and require bounded calibration before scientific default adoption. Archived task declarations and gates retain their original identities.

With run-attempt coverage, not run means no attempt; incompatible means a constructor refusal; blocked means a missing required artifact; diagnostic attempts retain separate-runtime outcomes. Other cohorts retain their recorded missing/preflight counts. All remain in the required denominator. PASS and FAIL both count as executed. Attempted errors retain their status and cause; changes to today's test definition are shown separately from execution coverage.

## discriminator_stability

**discriminator_stability — revision 14**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/discriminator_stability.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **13 / 16 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 1 / 5**. Its highest tier, Tier 4, has only held tests, so while they are held the view never shows PASS: a recipe that passes every counted tier gets HELD.

Calibration: **provisional**. Revision9 recipe-owned prior comparisons are provisional and require bounded calibration before scientific default adoption. Archived task declarations and gates retain their original identities.

## lazy_cadence_coverage

**lazy_cadence_coverage — revision 1**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/lazy_cadence_coverage.json).

Separately scoped cohort. This ordinary lane retains its own required gates and execution policy; its measurements are excluded from family totals and give no parent-cohort credit.

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **0 / 0 / 0 / 0**.

Calibration: **undeclared**. Calibration and robustness are separate from recorded task passes.

With run-attempt coverage, not run means no attempt; incompatible means a constructor refusal; blocked means a missing required artifact; diagnostic attempts retain separate-runtime outcomes. Other cohorts retain their recorded missing/preflight counts. All remain in the required denominator. PASS and FAIL both count as executed. Attempted errors retain their status and cause; changes to today's test definition are shown separately from execution coverage.

## discriminator_stability

**discriminator_stability — revision 14**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/discriminator_stability.json).

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **13 / 16 / 1 / 0**. Held counts (measured and shown, not counted): **0 / 7 / 1 / 5**. Its highest tier, Tier 4, has only held tests, so while they are held the view never shows PASS: a recipe that passes every counted tier gets HELD.

Calibration: **provisional**. Revision9 recipe-owned prior comparisons are provisional and require bounded calibration before scientific default adoption. Archived task declarations and gates retain their original identities.

## lazy_cadence_coverage

**lazy_cadence_coverage — revision 1**. [View declaration](../../../configs/forge/views/lazy_cadence_coverage.json).

Separately scoped cohort. This ordinary lane retains its own required gates and execution policy; its measurements are excluded from family totals and give no parent-cohort credit.

Qualification requires every required experiment to pass, with all lower tiers and task dependencies passed first. Required counts (Tier 1 / 2 / 3 / 4): **0 / 0 / 0 / 0**.

Calibration: **undeclared**. Calibration and robustness are separate from recorded task passes.
