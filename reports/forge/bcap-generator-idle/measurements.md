# BCAP generator idle rule: every measurement

Executed source `94a6d429de0d01abc9fa3f993ed2089b741ef111`; protocol seed 0; ordinary revision 9.

Matched BCAP leader control and one declared threshold (generator_idle_se=1.0). All six Tier 1 gates govern Tier 2 admission. This is tuning evidence.

| Strength | Tier 1 passes | Tier 2 passes | Repaired | Regressed | Unresolved control passes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {'generator_idle_se': 1.0} | 5/6 | 0/21 | none | none | none |

Every task metric and its frozen numerical gate are retained below and in [results.json](results.json). Unreached tasks remain unmeasured.

The goal's [current leaderboard](../technique-inventory.md) remains the sole generated leaderboard; this table is a source-bound experimental comparison.
