# First comparable Full Atlas case: canonical two_pole

**FAIL** — fresh seed0, 80 outer updates, 24 ordinary live observations; final five at 67/70/74/77/80.

This test asks whether direct particles leave zero while the original critic stays bounded. Its unchanged gates are mean absolute particle coordinate ≥0.30 and median absolute critic slope ≤1.00. It does not require balanced coverage of both poles.

The public Recipe and ordered UpdatePolicy retain applicable Atlas controls, including learned training output noise. The host owns zero12×1 direct coordinates and the stored critic. Latent-prior multiplier/betas/A2 are inapplicable. Recipe.total_steps remains None;80 is the external test horizon. Measurements use live parameters with no evaluation draws.
