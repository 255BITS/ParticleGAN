# Local memory handoff scouts (no full-rollout training)

Completed runs only. Cold = zero-memory start. Warm = real prefix then generated writes only.
Reference-orbit pass requires radial RMSE < 0.1, direction consistency > 0.95,
signed-speed error < 0.03 rad/step, and first-point error < 0.2 reference radii.
This new composite is a diagnostic; see continuous errors and particle coverage in results.json.

## Continuous orbit progress (evaluation only)

Warm orbit quality: mean 1/((1+(relative radial error/.1)^2)*(1+(per-step signed angular error/.03)^2)), in [0,1]. Good steps require abs radial error<.1 and abs signed angular error<.03. Include the handoff transition from the last clean reference point. Good-arc turns are the longest consecutive good angular arc / (2*pi). Quality is a diagnostic, not a success probability, and does not measure absolute phase. Cold uses a single circle fit and signed speed from the first32 generated points, then holds them fixed; radius outside [.5,1.6] and speed outside [.08,.45] are penalized. Warm uses the true reference orbit. Report early and late scores separately.

Sorted by worst-prefix warm quality; full-circle/original-orbit passes remain primary.

## Interpretation and next-run candidates

- No new scout produced a passing cold-start circle at the long horizon; there is no winner on that metric.
- No scout yet passes reference-orbit fidelity for both prefix lengths; do not call a cold oscillator a solved handoff.
- All queued jobs have finished; rankings do not automatically promote a run or establish scientific success.

## Training cost

| Run | Point examples / update | Max real prefix | Memory size | D prediction / temporal weights | G calls D / G phase | Feedback probability / strength | Seconds / update |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| match_nearest25_5k | 512 | 63 | 32 | 0 / 0 | 4 / 4 | 0.5 / 0.25 | 0.1189 |
| match_shuffle25_5k | 512 | 63 | 32 | 0 / 0 | 4 / 4 | 0.5 / 0.25 | 0.1183 |

## Adversarial memory exploration

| Run | D judging memory | G adapter | Proposal gradient | Reader calls D / G phase | Legacy auxiliaries disabled |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| match_nearest25_5k | mixed | proposal | True | 8 / 8 | True |
| match_shuffle25_5k | mixed | proposal | True | 8 / 8 | True |

Clean judging: G reads the generated-write state, while both candidate scores
and B-cap use the same real-history memory, strictly before the target.
The proposal adapter uses two point-reader passes and stores no private state.
Reader calls include those internal passes; G calls count complete G evaluations.

## Local transition and recovery scouts

| Run | Shared judging weight | Replacement distribution / max or mild | Local pair GAN weight |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| match_nearest25_5k | 0.5 | fixed / 0.25 | 0.25 |
| match_shuffle25_5k | 0.5 | fixed / 0.25 | 0.25 |

Mixed judging averages separate clean/shared GAN losses and their default B-cap penalties.
The optional pair head judges two consecutive generated points against a real pair,
conditioned on real memory before both points. Its branch has one generated write
and is independent of point-loss exploration. Point/pair losses and penalties are
convexly weighted; the prior regularizer is applied once. No third generated point.
Uniform replacements range from zero to the configured maximum; mild_full selects
the mild value or one (default 25% full). Each update reuses its strengths in D and G.

## Local memory dynamics settings

| Run | Slow coordinates / rate | G adapter bottleneck | Repair target / weight / noise | Stability D / G weight / max gain |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| match_nearest25_5k | 0 / 0.1 | 16 | raw / 0 / 0.05 | 0 / 0 / 1.1 |
| match_shuffle25_5k | 0 / 0.1 | 16 | raw / 0 / 0.05 | 0 / 0 / 1.1 |

## Local history and future objectives

| Run | Mismatch weight / donors | Recovery noise / probability | Future weight / offsets | Query bands |
|---|---|---|---|---:|
| match_nearest25_5k | 0.25 / nearest | 0 / 0.5 | 0 / [0, 4, 12] | 0 |
| match_shuffle25_5k | 0.25 / shuffle | 0 / 0.5 | 0 / [0, 4, 12] | 0 |

Mismatch training ranks real continuations from other histories with the existing point head;
its D loss and default B-cap are normalized by 1+weight. G point loss stays unchanged.
Recovery perturbs prefix observations read by G; the pair judge retains the clean reference.
Future queries read identical prefix memory independently, with fixed z and explicit offsets.
Their joint GAN uses real future targets, no generated writes, and default exact B-cap.
Future weight convexly mixes this branch with the existing GAN; prior regularization stays once.

Scouts use local point GAN losses and optionally a two-point transition GAN. There is no full generated training
rollout or cold/warm path loss. Configured feedback adds at most one
generated write before each target; configs control G gradients through that write.
Longer rollouts are evaluation only.
Dense scouts use four points per episode; the older handoff_only trainer used one.
Architecture, context, corruption and optional D-only local auxiliary losses are explicit
config changes. Mismatched-history ranking changes the point head negative examples when enabled. Compare measured cost too.
Optional G repair trains a stateless read adapter. Local stability adds two parallel
one-step feedback branches per enabled phase, with detached prefix anchors and particles.
These local branches do not feed into another generated prediction; writer updates remain D-only.
No seed sweeps. B-cap defaults unchanged. Prior regularization applied once per update.
